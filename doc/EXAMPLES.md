# ðŸ“š Configuration examples

On this page you can see various examples of presence configs. For brevity
(texts and assets are self explanatory) only `[Presence]` part is shown unless
there is something peculiar to look at in text/assets configuration in this very
case.

## Static configuration

If you don't want your presence dynamic (e.g. changing depending on context),
you can stick to static configuration:

```ini
[Presence]
# Having this set to 'True' will ensure config will always be active.
Condition = True
# Highest priority will mean it will always be chosen as presence config.
Priority = 1000
# 'False' will disable evaluation of variables in texts.
Dynamic = False
```

## Fallback configuration

In case there are no active configurations available, the submod will clear the
activity display (but will maintain the connection to quickly render it again
when available.)

To ensure at least something is displayed, it is useful to have a *fallback*
config:

```ini
[Presence]
# Since this is set to 'True', this config will always be active.
Condition = True
# With the lowest priority, this config will only be chosen when no other
# configs are available.
Priority = -1000
Dynamic = True
```

## Time of day based configuration

Using `mas_globals.time_of_day_4state` variable, you can create a config that
will only become active in your desired time of day. Available values (put
them in `""` after `==`):
* `morning`
* `afternoon`
* `evening`
* `night`

```ini
[Presence]
Condition = mas_globals.time_of_day_4state == "morning"
Priority = -950
Dynamic = True
```
