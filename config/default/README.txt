This is the config for the Discord Presence Submod written by the original
submod author and used as the sensible default for new users. While the submod
will work perfectly fine without it, or with your own config to replace it,
it is recommended that you keep this folder ("default") and rather add other
configuration files to the actual "config" folder (you may create any folder
structure as you like).

It is done that way so the official extensions (see "extensions" folder) and
actual configs can be updated when a new submod update is released, however, in
order not to overwrite your own changes your configs should use priority above 0
so that they will always override the default config.
