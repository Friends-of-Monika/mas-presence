This folder contains configuration files for the Discord Presence Submod that
define what presence is chosen for display and what is shown on it.

NOTE: To keep default presence configs updated with new submod releases, they
were put into default/ folder which you should not touch, and rather put your
own configs outside this folder and set their priority to values above 0 so they
will override defaults.

The config system is made to be simple but infinitely extensible, however if
you're having trouble figuring out how to configure things, check out this page:
