This folder contains configuration files for the Discord Presence Submod that
define what presence is chosen for display and what is shown on it.

To keep default presence configs updated with new submod releases, they
were put into default/ folder which you should not touch, and rather put your
own configs outside this folder and set their priority to values greater than
specified in default configs so they will override them (see customization guide
by following the link below.)

The config system is made to be simple but infinitely extensible, however if
you're having trouble figuring out how to configure things, check out this page:
